# Space Complexity

- Commonly confused with auxiliary space
  - **Auxiliary space** is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

## What is it?

**Space Complexity** of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.

## What do you take into account

- Function call
- Data Structures
- Allocations
- Declaration of Variables
