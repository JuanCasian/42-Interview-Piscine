# Time Complexity

- Used to analyze how good an algorithm is

## What is it?

Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

## How to calculate it?

1. Check the operations you do
2. Define the time complexity of every operation (how many times will it run)
3. Put the time complexities together and add them up

- You will usually ignore constants
- You O(n) comes when you have loops
  - O(n^2) is when you have a loop inside a loop etc
- O(i):
  - Operations
  - Comparisons
  - Pointer referencing
  - Funcitons Calls to outside
