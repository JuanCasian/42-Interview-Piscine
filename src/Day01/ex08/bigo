Time complexity 
	-  average time = O(N + E) ; where N is the number of nodes and E will be the number of edges
		- because I will only visit once each node
	-  Worst case = O(N^2) ; where N is the number of nodes
		- because in order to look for the checked nodes and the parents I need to iterate through a list of nodes

Space complexity = O(n * 3) ; where n is the number of nodes
	- Because I create more linked list with the nodes to look for parents and visited nodes and a queue
