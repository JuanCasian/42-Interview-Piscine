Spacetime complexity = O(1) ; for all except the add
	- O(n) ;  for add method

Timecomplexity = O(n) ; where n is word length -> this for all except whatWasThat 
	- O(n * (m + r)) ; where n is the number of words in the dict and m is the number of letters in word and r
		is the number of letters in dictionary words
