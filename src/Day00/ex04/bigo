Time complexity:
	- Average: O(n+m) ; where m is the pattern size and n is the text size
	- Worst case: O(nm) ; where m is the pattern size and n is the text size
		- This would happen if all the hashes where the same

Space complexity:
	- O(1) 
		- Because again we are not adding memory, and the values are passed as references
			- We add some variables but space still remains constant
