Time Complexity = O(1) ;
	- because you are just supose to have one item per hash table entry, even do some times you can get colisions the 
		average should be constant
Space Complexity = O(n) ; where n is the number of art pieces
	- because you are creating new hash table items for each of the art pieces

**Note: If you don't take into account the hash table creation then your space complexity would be O(1)
