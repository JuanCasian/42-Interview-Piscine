1) External sorting because you won't probably have enough ram to sort it.
2) Counting sort because it is a limited range and it is run in O(n + k)
3) Insertion sort or bubble sort, becasue they have O(1) space complexity, 
	insertion sort mostly because it performs better than bubble sort if the array is kind of sorted
4) Insertion sort because you wont do a liot of moves to put them in the right place, and you won't use a lot of memory
5) Insertion sort because it won't take more than O(n) to put that one into place
