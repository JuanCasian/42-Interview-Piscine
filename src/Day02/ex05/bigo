Time complexity:
	- Average : O(log(n)) ; where n is the number of elements in the array
		- because you are doing a binary search on int
	- Worst case : O(n) ; this would happen if you have an array in which you can't decide to go left or right
		- {2, 0 ,2 ,2 ,2 ,2 ,2}

Space complexity: O(1); because the eleements are passed as pointer
