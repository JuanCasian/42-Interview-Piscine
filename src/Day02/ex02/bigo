Time complexity: 
	- Worst case: O(n^2) ; when the pivot is always the biggest element
	- Avergae/best case: O(nlog(n)) ; when your pivot is always the middle point
Space complexity:
	- Average: O (log(n)); because of the calls you do to the stack
	= Worst : O(n); when your pivot is always the max

- Still not sure if the stack calls are counted to the space complexity, because you are passing the arrays as a pointer
