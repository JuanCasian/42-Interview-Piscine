Space complexity = O(G) ; G is the number of groups
	- because I create a group structure per each group

Time complexity 
	- Worst case: O(G^2) ; where G is the number of groups they are
		- becuase if the whole thing is sorted backwards
	- Best case O(G) ; when the list is sorted

- The algorithm is optimized to work with the grouped numbers and if the array is sorted before the end of
	the bubble sort then it won't continue sorting
